# SRE-skill-set
Key Principles of SRE
Embracing Risk: Balancing system dependability and innovation through managed risk-taking for speedier development cycles.

Service Level Objectives (SLOs):
Establishing quantifiable objectives for reliability.

To measure performance, use metrics such as Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and error budgets.
Eliminating Toil
Automating repetitious chores without long-term benefit.

Allowing teams to focus on strategic improvements.

Monitoring and Observability
Obtaining detailed insights into system behaviour via logs, metrics, and traces.

Providing actionable notifications to prevent "alert fatigue".
